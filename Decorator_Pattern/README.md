## Decorator

The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to add behavior or responsibilities to objects dynamically, without altering their existing code. It is a way to extend the functionality of objects in a flexible and reusable manner, making it an essential tool in object-oriented design.

### When to Use the Decorator Pattern

You should consider using the Decorator pattern in the following situations:

1. **Adding Features Dynamically**: When you need to add new features or behaviors to an object without modifying its source code. Decorators provide a way to enhance objects at runtime, making them more versatile and adaptable.

2. **Combining Features**: When you have a set of basic components and want to combine them in various ways to create complex objects with different combinations of features. The Decorator pattern allows you to mix and match decorators to achieve the desired functionality.

3. **Open-Closed Principle**: When you want to follow the Open-Closed Principle, which states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. The Decorator pattern promotes code openness by allowing you to extend the behavior of classes without changing their existing code.

4. **Maintaining Single Responsibility**: When you want to ensure that each class has a single responsibility. Instead of creating monolithic classes with multiple responsibilities, you can use decorators to encapsulate individual responsibilities and compose them as needed.

The Decorator pattern is widely used in frameworks and libraries, where it enables the creation of diverse and customizable objects by combining simple building blocks. It promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it an invaluable tool for designing flexible and extensible systems.

Understanding and applying the Decorator pattern is a fundamental skill for developers seeking to create modular and adaptable software architectures. It complements other design patterns and can be used in conjunction with them to achieve more sophisticated design solutions.
