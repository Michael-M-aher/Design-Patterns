## Factory Method

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It falls under the category of creational design patterns and is a key part of object-oriented design.

### When to Use the Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern is beneficial in the following scenarios:

1. **Object Creation Variability**: When you need to create objects, but the exact type of object isn't known until runtime or depends on specific conditions within the application. The Factory Method abstracts the object creation process and delegates it to subclasses, allowing for flexibility in object instantiation.

2. **Decoupling Creator and Concrete Classes**: When you want to decouple the code that creates objects (the creator) from the code that uses these objects (the client). This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and promotes the open-closed principle, which encourages adding new types of objects without modifying existing code.

3. **Common Interface for Multiple Products**: When you have a family of related or dependent objects that share a common interface but have varying implementations. The Factory Method ensures that objects adhere to a common interface, enabling clients to work with them uniformly.

4. **Testing and Mocking**: When you want to simplify unit testing by allowing you to substitute actual object creation with mock objects or test doubles, aiding in unit testing and test-driven development (TDD).

In summary, the Factory Method design pattern provides a structured way to create objects while promoting flexibility, maintainability, and scalability in your software architecture. It is particularly useful when you anticipate changes in the types of objects to be created or when you want to keep your codebase open for extension but closed for modification.
