## Template Design Pattern

The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the form of a template method, allowing sub-classes to alter certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This pattern promotes code reusability and provides a consistent framework for related algorithms while allowing for customization of specific steps.

### When to Use the Template Design Pattern

The Template Design Pattern is useful in the following scenarios:

1. **Common Algorithm Structure**: When you have multiple algorithms that share a common structure but may have different implementations for certain steps. The template method defines the common structure, while concrete subclasses provide the varying implementations.

2. **Avoiding Code Duplication**: To avoid duplicating code across multiple classes that follow a similar algorithm but differ in specific steps. By using a template method, you centralize the common code, making maintenance and updates more efficient.

3. **Enforcing a Sequence**: When you need to enforce a specific sequence of steps in an algorithm. The template method ensures that the steps are executed in a predefined order, even if some of them are overridden in subclasses.

4. **Framework Development**: When building a framework or library where you want to provide a standard interface for users to extend. Users can create their subclasses to customize the behavior within the framework's predefined structure.

In essence, the Template Design Pattern provides a blueprint for an algorithm, allowing for flexibility in specific implementations while maintaining a consistent overall structure. It simplifies code maintenance, enhances code readability, and encourages adherence to best practices by enforcing a well-defined sequence of steps.
