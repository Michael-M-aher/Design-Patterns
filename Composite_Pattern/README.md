## Composite

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In essence, it enables you to build complex structures from simpler building blocks, and these structures can be treated as if they were individual objects.

### Key Concepts

The Composite pattern introduces the following key concepts:

1. **Component**: This is the common interface or base class that both individual objects and compositions of objects must implement. It defines the methods and properties that are common to all elements in the hierarchy.

2. **Leaf**: A Leaf is a concrete implementation of the Component interface. It represents individual objects that don't have any children in the hierarchy. In other words, they are the building blocks of the composite structure.

3. **Composite**: A Composite is another concrete implementation of the Component interface. It represents a collection of objects, including both Leafs and other Composites, arranged in a tree structure. Composites can have children, which can be Leafs or other Composites.

### When to Use the Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern is beneficial in the following scenarios:

1. **Part-Whole Hierarchies**: When you have a hierarchical structure made up of parts that can be further divided into smaller parts, and you want to treat both individual parts and composed structures uniformly.

2. **Simplifying Client Code**: When you want to simplify client code by allowing it to interact with complex structures in the same way it interacts with individual objects. Clients don't need to distinguish between Leafs and Composites.

3. **Recursive Structures**: When you need to work with recursive structures, such as the DOM of a web page, where elements can contain other elements, and you want to apply operations to the entire structure.

The Composite pattern promotes code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility by providing a unified way to work with complex hierarchies. It's commonly used in user interface frameworks, graphics systems, and any scenario where you need to represent part-whole relationships in a consistent manner.
