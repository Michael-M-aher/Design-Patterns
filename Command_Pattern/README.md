## Command Design Pattern

The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides the capability to support undoable operations and transactional behavior. This pattern decouples the sender and receiver of a request, enabling greater flexibility and extensibility in your software architecture.

### Key Concepts

- **Command**: This is the core element of the pattern. It represents an action to be performed and typically includes an operation, its arguments, and references to the receiver object. Command objects abstractly encapsulate these details.

- **Invoker**: The Invoker is responsible for invoking commands. It maintains a collection of Command objects and can support various operations, such as queuing, logging, and undo.

- **Receiver**: The Receiver is the object that performs the actual work associated with a command. It knows how to carry out specific operations.

- **Client**: The Client initiates the request by creating a Command object and associating it with a Receiver. It then passes this Command to the Invoker to execute.

- **Undoable Commands**: One of the significant advantages of the Command pattern is its support for undo and redo operations. Commands can be designed to store the state required to reverse their effects, allowing for easy undo functionality.

### When to Use the Command Pattern

Consider using the Command pattern when:

1. You want to parameterize objects with operations.
2. You need to support queuing of requests or operations.
3. You want to implement undo/redo functionality.
4. You want to decouple the sender and receiver of requests, promoting a flexible and extensible architecture.
5. You need a transactional behavior, where a series of operations can be treated as a single unit.

The Command pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to maintain a history of operations, provide an intuitive way to extend functionality, or implement advanced features like macro recording and playback in applications.
